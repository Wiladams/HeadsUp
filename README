HeadsUp provides an environment within which to run Lua scripts that use OpenGL.

This is similar to wlua.exe as it is a Windows application, but beyond that
you can do whatever you want.

There are some global functions that HeadsUp looks for in your code:

init() - Called once to initialize your script
display() - Called for every frame (currently fixed to 30 fps)
ontick(tickCount) - Called once per frame


The model of interaction is very similar to that of GLUT.  Basically just
do your setup, and start drawing.
